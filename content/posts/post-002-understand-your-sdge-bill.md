## What is a CCA?

A CCA, or Community Choice Aggregation, is a program that allows cities and counties to purchase electricity from alternative sources, often with a higher percentage of renewable energy sources, while still relying on the existing utility company (in this case, SDGE) for transmission and distribution services. By participating in a CCA, customers have the option to choose an electricity provider other than the traditional utility company.

## Common Residential Rate Plans:

1. Standard Plan: This is the default rate plan for residential customers who have not opted for any other plan. It has a flat rate for electricity usage, regardless of the time of day or season.

2. TOU-DR (Time-of-Use with Demand Response): This plan offers different electricity rates based on the time of day and season. It incentivizes customers to shift their energy usage to off-peak hours (when demand is lower) by offering lower rates during those times. TOU-DR plans typically have three or four pricing periods: on-peak, semi-peak, off-peak, and potentially a super off-peak period.

## Identifying your CCA on an SDGE Bill:

To determine if a customer is enrolled in a CCA, look for the dedicated section on the bill. If it shows a provider other than SDGE, such as "San Diego Community Power" or "Clean Energy Alliance," the customer is enrolled in a CCA.

## Identifying your Plan on an SDGE Bill:

To identify the billing rate plan, look for the "Rate" section on the bill. It will display the specific rate plan, such as "TOU-DR" for the Time-of-Use with Demand Response plan.

By understanding these details, customers can make informed decisions about their electricity provider and rate plan choices, potentially saving money and supporting renewable energy initiatives.
