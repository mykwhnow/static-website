# Holidays Observed by California Electric Utilities for TOU Rate Schedules

If you're on a **Time-of-Use (TOU)** electricity plan, holidays can mean **lower rates all day** — but **only if your utility recognizes them**.

While most utilities follow a similar holiday schedule, there are a few differences worth knowing, especially for customers of LADWP, Liberty Utilities, and SMUD.

## ✅ Standard TOU Holidays (SDG&E, PG&E, SCE)

The following **eight holidays are observed** by the state's three largest investor-owned utilities. On these days, **off-peak rates apply for the full 24 hours**:

- New Year's Day
- Presidents' Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Veterans Day
- Thanksgiving Day
- Christmas Day
