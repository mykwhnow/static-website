# A Conservative Energy Guide to Appliance Costs in California

Electricity prices in California vary **significantly by provider and region**. Whether you're in **San Diego**, **Los Angeles**, or **Rural Northern California**, the actual cost to run your appliances can be **very different** — even with the same equipment and usage.

This guide provides a **conservative estimate** of what common appliances cost to run, using an average rate of **$0.14 per kWh** as a baseline. Some Californians pay less. Many — especially those in San Diego — pay much more during peak hours.

## ⚡ Understanding Rate Differences

California’s electric market is divided across multiple utilities, each with their own Time-of-Use (TOU) rate schedules. While some parts of the state may see off-peak rates under $0.20/kWh, peak periods in San Diego County (SDG&E territory) often exceed **$0.50/kWh**.

## 🧮 Conservative Appliance Cost Estimates (at 14¢ per kWh)

These numbers offer a **low-estimate baseline** — they help you understand *minimum* likely costs. If you're in an area like San Diego or with limited off-peak hours, you’ll want to **multiply** accordingly.

| Appliance                  | Power (Watts) | Daily Use | Monthly Cost (14¢/kWh) |
|---------------------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Refrigerator (Energy Star)| 150 W         | 24 hrs    | $15.12                  |
| LED Light Bulb (x5)       | 50 W total    | 5 hrs/day | $1.05                   |
| Microwave Oven            | 1000 W        | 15 min/day| $1.05                   |
| Laptop Charger            | 60 W          | 4 hrs/day | $1.01                   |
| Window AC Unit            | 1000 W        | 4 hrs/day | $17.00                  |
| Clothes Washer            | 500 W         | 5 uses/mo | $0.17                   |
| Clothes Dryer (electric)  | 3000 W        | 5 uses/mo | $2.10                   |
| Dishwasher                | 1200 W        | 10 uses/mo| $1.68                   |
| Electric Oven             | 2500 W        | 30 min/day| $5.25                   |
| Coffee Maker              | 900 W         | 20 min/day| $1.26                   |

> ℹ️ **Multiply by your actual kWh cost**  
> Example: In **San Diego**, where peak pricing can reach **$0.55/kWh**, that $5.25/month oven could cost you closer to **$20/month** — or more if used during peak.

## 🏷️ A Note on Energy Guide Labels

You’ve probably seen the **yellow Energy Guide stickers** on appliances — they usually assume **$0.14/kWh**, which no longer reflects what many Californians actually pay.

That means those guides **underestimate** costs in most parts of the state.

## 📍 San Diego as a Case Study

In **San Diego**, electricity pricing is among the **highest in the country**. During peak hours (4–9 PM), SDG&E rates often exceed **$0.50/kWh** — more than **3.5×** the national average.

With that rate, using a standard clothes dryer (3kW) for just 1 hour can cost **$1.50 or more**.

For San Diego residents, shifting use to off-peak hours or investing in **solar + storage** can lead to substantial savings.

## 📌 Takeaways

- Always check your **actual kWh rate**, not just the Energy Guide label.
- Use **real-time TOU data** by region at [mykwhnow.com/tools/california-rates](https://mykwhnow.com/tools/california-rates).
- Consider the **time of day** and your **location** when calculating appliance costs.
- In high-cost areas like **San Diego**, efficiency and usage habits make a major impact on your bill.
