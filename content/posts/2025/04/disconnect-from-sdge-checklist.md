title: "Thinking About Going Off-Grid in San Diego? Here’s Your Complete Checklist"
description: "Whether you're driven by rising rates, a desire for energy independence, or frustration with changing utility policies, living 'off the grid' is a bold move — and one that requires careful planning. If you're a customer of San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), here’s a complete checklist to guide your journey."

## ✅ Off-Grid Disconnection Checklist (SDG&E Customers)

### 1. Understand the Utility Disconnection Process
- **Contact SDG&E** to notify them of your intent to terminate service.
- Review any **legal requirements** or restrictions from your city or county — not all areas allow full disconnection.
- Expect **paperwork, final inspections, and potential fees** (like meter removal or reconnection charges if you change your mind).

### 2. Calculate Your Energy Needs

Before you design your system, you need to understand your actual energy usage. Instead of guessing or digging through bills:

➡️ [**Download your Green Button Data from SDG&E**](https://mykwhnow.com/blog/post-006-how-to-download-my-green-data-from-myeneregycenter)

This gives you detailed hourly usage over the past 12+ months — perfect for sizing your solar and battery needs accurately.

Look for:
- **Total daily consumption** in kWh
- **Peak load hours** (e.g., when AC kicks in)
- **Seasonal variation** (especially in summer vs. winter)

### 3. Design Your Independent Power System
- **Solar panels**: Primary generation source for Southern California
- **Battery storage**: Cover nights and cloudy days (plan for multiple days of autonomy)
- **Inverter + charge controller**: For safe DC/AC conversion and charging
- **Backup generator**: A must-have for cloudy weeks, maintenance periods, or emergencies

### 4. Plan for Redundancy — Don’t Rely on a Single Point of Failure

Going off-grid is more like running a **miniature utility company** than just installing solar panels. Like in aviation, where **airplanes have 2 or 3 backup systems** for every critical function, your energy system should have **layers of redundancy**:

- **Multiple inverters or charge controllers**, where feasible
- Keep **critical spare parts** on hand — think fuses, relays, cabling, even an extra **MPPT charge controller**
- Use **locally sourced equipment** when possible to avoid shipping delays

> Imagine your inverter dies in July — and the replacement part is a European-manufactured unit with a 3-week lead time due to customs. How long can your household run without power?

Being truly off-grid means planning for the unexpected — not just the sunny days.

### 5. Boost Energy Efficiency
- Upgrade to **Energy Star appliances**
- Use **LED lighting**, **smart thermostats**, and **timer-controlled loads**
- Consider reducing non-essential loads (e.g., electric dryers, hot tubs)

The less energy you need, the smaller and more affordable your off-grid system can be.

### 6. Permits & Inspections
- Apply for **electrical permits** for your off-grid system
- Confirm **zoning compliance** for battery or solar installations
- Schedule final **inspections** before grid disconnection

### 7. Disconnect From the Grid
- Work with SDG&E to safely **remove your meter and connection**
- Ensure you're compliant with **local building, fire, and utility codes**

### 8. Monitor and Maintain
- Use smart tools to monitor **solar generation, battery health, and usage**
- Set a routine for:
  - **Cleaning panels**
  - **Checking cables and terminals**
  - **Running backup generators monthly**
- Track seasonal shifts and adjust accordingly

## 💰 Financial Considerations

### ❌ What You Give Up / Risks

- **No more California Climate Credit**  
  Disconnecting removes you from eligibility for the [California Climate Credit](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/climatecredit/), which can total over **$100 annually** for SDG&E customers.

- **No net energy metering (NEM)**  
  Any excess solar you produce can’t be exported for credits — you must store or use it.

- **You are 100% responsible for uptime**  
  If a key part fails — like your **inverter** — you're out of power until it’s replaced. In aviation, redundancy is a rule: _two is one, one is none._ Apply that logic to your power system.

### ✅ What You Avoid

- **No more non-bypassable charges**  
  Even with solar, SDG&E customers must pay **non-bypassable charges** — fixed fees that apply even when using your own solar power. Going off-grid frees you from these charges entirely.

## ⚖️ Not Ready to Go All-In?

Full disconnection isn’t the only path. Many households opt for a **hybrid setup**:
- Solar + battery for reliability
- Grid as a backup
- Potential for net metering and climate credit retention
