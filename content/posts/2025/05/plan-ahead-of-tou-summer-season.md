# TOU Summer Is Almost Here: What It Means and How to Get Ahead

June 1 isn't just the start of summer break — it's the beginning of **"TOU Summer"** in California, when electricity prices often shift dramatically depending on **when** and **where** you use power.

In Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing, **summer months are billed at higher rates**, especially during afternoon and evening hours. But the **exact timing of the summer season** depends on your utility.

With just **two weeks to go**, here's what you need to know — and a few things you can still do to get ahead of it.

## ☀️ TOU Summer vs. Winter: What’s the Difference?

In TOU rate plans, the year is divided into **"summer" and "winter" seasons**, each with different price structures. Why?

- **Summer** = more demand = higher generation and delivery costs
- **Winter** = lower overall demand, fewer peak price hours

In most of California, **TOU summer starts on June 1** — but not everywhere. Some regions extend summer into October; others keep it shorter.

## ⚡ What Changes in Summer?

- **Peak prices rise:** Afternoon and evening hours (4–9 PM) get more expensive
- **Off-peak hours shrink:** Cheaper nighttime or morning rates may still apply — but the savings gap is smaller
- **Appliance use becomes costlier:** Dryers, ovens, and AC use hit harder during peak
