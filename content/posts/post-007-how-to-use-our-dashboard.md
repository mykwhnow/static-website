The primary purpose of MyKWhNow.com and its main dashboard is to help you find your current electricity cost with just a few clicks. Whether you are trying to better understand your energy expenses or looking for ways to save, MyKWhNow.com provides a simple and effective way to access the information you need.

## Getting Started: Do You Know Your RIN?

If you're a California resident, you're in luck! MyKWhNow.com is designed to cater to your specific needs. However, if you reside outside California, we encourage you to join our mailing list to stay informed about the latest developments.

There are 2 ways to use the dashboard, either with RINs or without:

## You know your RIN:

If you already know your RIN (Rate Identification Number), which is a 19-character code identifying your rate, you can easily select it from the dropdown menu.

If this RIN is for distribution only, the energy (also referred to as production) RIN selector will become available allowing you to select the second RIN from your Community Choice Aggregator (CCA).

If you do not know your RIN, you might be able to [find it on your electricity bill](/blog/post-008-help-me-find-my-RIN).

Here's an example of how your current electricity cost would look with a classic TOUDR plan using a combination of SDG&E and CEA:

## You do not know your RIN? No Problem!

If you don't know your RIN, you can still use MyKWhNow.com to find your electricity cost. Here's how:

## Energy Distribution:

Identify your Electricity distributor. California has 5 main electricity Regions:

- PG&E: Pacific Gas and Electric
- SCE: Southern California Edison
- SDG&E: San Diego Gas & Electric
- LADWP: Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
- SMUD: Sacramento Municipal Utility District

Then find your rate using your electricity bill. You can also refer to [this article](/blog/post-001-understand-electric-rates-in-san-diego) to help you read your electricity bill.

## CCA - Energy Production

If your electricity is produced by a different entity than its distributor, MyKWhNow.com can handle that for you. Learn more about [CCAs](/blog/post-003-community-choice-aggregation-for-electricity-generation/) and how it affects your energy distribution.

## Examples of large CCAs:

- Clean Power Alliance (CPA) - Los Angeles, Ventura
- Peninsula Clean Energy (PCE) - San Mateo, parts of Santa Clara
- MCE (formerly Marin Clean Energy) - Marin, Napa, Contra Costa, Solano
- San Diego Community Power (SDCP) - San Diego, Imperial
- Silicon Valley Clean Energy (SVCE) - Santa Clara
- East Bay Community Energy (EBCE) - Alameda, parts of San Joaquin
- Sonoma Clean Power (SCP) - Sonoma, Mendocino
- Monterey Bay Community Power (now Central Coast Community Energy - 3CE) - Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Benito, parts of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara
- CleanPowerSF - San Francisco

Once you've identified your CCA, simply select your energy distributor on the left and your CCA on the right:
