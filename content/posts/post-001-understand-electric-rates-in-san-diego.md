As a San Diego resident, you've likely noticed some variation in your monthly electric bill charges and rates depending on your electricity provider. San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), The Clean Energy Alliance (CEA), and San Diego Community Power (SDCP) all offer different rate structures and charge breakdowns within certain geographic areas. Let's take a closer look:

## SDGE My Charges

Your SDG&E electric bill breaks down the various charges that make up your total amount due throughout SDG&E's service territory in San Diego County and southern Orange County. This includes costs for the actual electricity usage, as well as fees for transmission, distribution, and other utility operations. Understanding each line item can help shed light on what you're paying for. [Learn more about SDGE My Charges.](https://www.sdge.com/mybill)

In addition to the charge breakdown, SDG&E provides access to both current and historical residential electric rates. This allows you to see how rates have changed over time and research past pricing across their service area. Knowledge of rate trends can be helpful for budgeting purposes.

## CEA Residential Electric Rates

The Clean Energy Alliance is a community choice energy program that offers an alternative to SDG&E for electricity generation in the cities of Carlsbad, Del Mar, and Solana Beach. CEA publishes its own set of residential rates for these areas, which can differ from SDG&E's rates. Comparing the two can help eligible residents evaluate their options.

SDCP aims to provide renewable energy at competitive prices compared to SDG&E's standard rates for areas it serves.
