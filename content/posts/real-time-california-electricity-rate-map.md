# New Tool Launch: Real-Time Time-of-Use (TOU) Electricity Rates by California County

We‚Äôre excited to introduce our newest tool: the [**Real-Time TOU Rates Map**](https://mykwhnow.com/tools/california-rates), a live interactive experience that lets you explore electricity rates across all California counties **as they are right now**.

## ‚ö° Why Real-Time Matters

Most TOU rate maps you‚Äôll find online are **static** ‚Äî they show standard rate schedules or outdated estimates. But electricity pricing under TOU structures changes hourly, sometimes drastically.

Take San Diego as an example. Earlier today, SDG&E‚Äôs residential TOUDR rate began the morning at **$0.47787/kWh**. But starting at 6:00 AM, that jumped to **$0.49602/kWh**, and by mid-afternoon, it peaked at **$0.55858/kWh** ‚Äî a **17% increase in just a few hours**. This kind of shift can significantly impact your energy bill if you're not tuned in.

Real-time pricing data empowers Californians to make smarter, money-saving energy decisions ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs scheduling your EV charge, running the dishwasher, or cooling the house.

## üåç What the Map Shows

The map provides:

- **Current TOU rate per county**
- **Utility provider name**
- **Linked RIN (Retailer Identifier Number)** for deeper analysis
- Live updates throughout the day as rate periods change

Counties like **Los Angeles (LADWP)** or **Sacramento (SMUD)** often show much lower rates, such as **$0.23317** and **$0.1215/kWh**, respectively, compared to PG&E or SDG&E areas, which trend above **$0.47/kWh**.
