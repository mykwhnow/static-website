If you're a California resident, you've probably noticed a line item called the "California Climate Credit" on your electricity and natural gas bills twice a year. But what exactly is this credit, and why do you receive it?

The California Climate Credit is part of the state's efforts to combat climate change by promoting clean energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It works hand-in-hand with California's cap-and-trade program, which requires power plants, natural gas providers, and other large industrial facilities to purchase permits for releasing greenhouse gases.

The money raised from selling these permits funds the Climate Credit, which is then passed along to residential utility customers. All Californians who are residential electricity and natural gas customers receive the credit, regardless of their individual energy usage or rate plan. Even if you have solar panels or an electric vehicle, you still qualify.

The credit amount varies by utility provider, as it is determined by greenhouse gas emission allowance prices, not customer usage levels. For 2024, the twice-yearly credit amounts are:

- PG&E: $55.17
- Southern California Edison: $86.00
- San Diego Gas & Electric: $78.22
- Bear Valley Electric: $32.24
- Liberty Utilities: $131.01
- Pacific Power: $174.25

You'll see these credit amounts applied to your utility bills in April and October 2024.

The California Climate Credit program is expected to continue at least through 2030 as the state pursues its ambitious goals for emissions reductions and clean energy adoption. While the credits are modest compared to overall utility costs, they provide a helpful offset while raising awareness of California's climate change mitigation efforts.

So the next time you see that line item on your utility statement, remember that it represents California's commitment to environmental sustainability and your contribution to building a cleaner future for the state. Every little bit helps in the fight against climate change!
