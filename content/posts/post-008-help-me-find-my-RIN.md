## What is a RIN?

A RIN is a unique identifier created by the California Energy Commission (CEC) for customers on time-of-use pricing plans, enabling access to hourly electric pricing details. The RIN consists of 19 characters, including a region code (e.g., USCA), a provider code (e.g., SD, PG, LA), and a unique identifier (e.g., 0001-0000), formatted like this: USCA-SDSD-0001-0000.

## Where to Find Your RIN

You can easily find your RIN on your electricity bill, usually accompanied by a QR code. A QR code is a two-dimensional barcode made up of black squares on a white background, which can be scanned with most smartphone cameras.

## If You Do Not Have a CCA

If your energy provider (e.g., SDGE, PG&E, SCE) is the same as your energy producer, you will have a single RIN, with the provider code repeated in the second section (e.g., PGPG).

## If You Have a CCA

If you have a Community Choice Aggregator (CCA), your energy is provided by two different entities, each with its own RIN.
