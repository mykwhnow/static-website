title: "Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) for Electricity Generation in California and Beyond"
description: "Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) programs allow local governments to purchase and generate electricity, often from renewable sources, giving consumers an alternative to incumbent utilities. While originating in California, CCA programs have been adopted in several other states, providing local control over electricity sources, promoting renewable energy, and introducing competition in the electricity market."

Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) is a program that allows cities, counties, and other jurisdictions to purchase and/or generate electricity supplies on behalf of the residents, businesses, and municipal accounts in their communities. While CCA programs originated in California, they have also been adopted in several other states across the United States.

## The Primary Goals and Features of CCA Programs:

1. Local Control: CCAs give local governments more control over their electricity sources, enabling them to choose cleaner, renewable energy sources if desired.
2. Procurement of Electricity: CCAs can purchase or generate electricity from various sources, including renewables like solar, wind, and geothermal, as well as conventional sources like natural gas.
3. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction: Many CCAs prioritize procuring electricity from renewable sources, which can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generation.
4. Competition and Consumer Choice: CCAs introduce competition in the electricity market, giving consumers a choice between the CCA program and the incumbent utility company.
5. Rate Setting: CCAs can set their own electricity rates, which may be higher or lower than the incumbent utility's rates, depending on various factors like the cost of procuring electricity and operational costs.
6. Opt-Out Provision: Customers in the CCA's service area are automatically enrolled in the program, but they have the option to opt-out and remain with the incumbent utility if they choose.

## States with Active CCA Programs:

While California was an early adopter and has the most active CCA programs, several other states have also implemented or enabled CCA models for electricity procurement, including:

- Illinois
- Ohio
- Massachusetts
- New Jersey
- New York
- Rhode Island
- Virginia

## Opting Back Into a CCA Program:

If you have previously opted out of a CCA program, you can typically opt back in by following these steps:

1. Contact the CCA program in your area, either by phone, email, or through their website.
2. Request to opt back in and provide any required information, such as your account number with the incumbent utility.
3. Fill out any necessary forms or provide additional documentation, like a recent utility bill.
4. Specify the desired start date for re-enrollment, if given the option.
5. Wait for the enrollment process, which may take a billing cycle or two, as the CCA coordinates with the incumbent utility.

It's important to note that the specific opt-in process and any enrollment periods or deadlines can vary between different CCA programs, so it's advisable to check the instructions provided by your local CCA.
